Dot Product of Two Arrays in Java
Instructions:

Write a Java program that:

    1. Creates two integer arrays a and b, each of length n.

    2. Fills both arrays with randomly generated integer values (you may use java.util.Random or Math.random()).

    3. Computes a third array c such that:

      c[i]=a[i]×b[i],for i=0,1,…,n−1
    4. Prints the original arrays a and b, followed by the resulting array c.

    5. Test your program with n = 5.

Once your program runs successfully:

  * Save and upload your Java source file(s) to the lab1-dot-product directory on GitHub.
  * Take screenshots of the program running and showing the generated arrays and their dot product.



Output:

a[] = [3, 1, 1, 1, 2]

b[] = [4, 3, 3, 1, 0]

c[] = [12, 3, 3, 1, 0]
